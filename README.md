##Overview

##Module Description

The Samba module manages the install and configuration of samba, and follows the manual
pages for samba as close as possible.  The module aims to be feature complete in regard
to the manuals.

##Setup

}
```

To manage the winbind server:

```puppet
class { 'samba':
  server_manage  => true,
  winbind_manage => true,
}
```

To manage a samba share, use the share defined type:

```puppet
samba::share { 'test':
  share_name     => 'test',
  share_comment  => 'MODULES SHOULD GO TO FORGE',
  share_path     => '/vagrant',
